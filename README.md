> ***Motivation***: The rapid urbanization and the increasing wastewater discharge demands improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).This can help reduce operating costs and helps towards sustainable goals. Machine learning is considered the latest solution for exploring the possibilities of improving WWTP operating status in future period by modelling. The primary indicators that affects the WWTP's efficiency are influent Chemical oxygen demand (COD), Nitrate concentration etc. Predicting the COD values can give us an idea about the energy consumption of the WWTP.  

> ***Objective***: To predict COD parameter of WWTP using random forest model, display plot of recorded and predicted values using a GUI.
