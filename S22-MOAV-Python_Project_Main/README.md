> ***Motivation***: The rapid urbanization and the increasing wastewater discharge demands improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).This can help reduce operating costs and helps towards sustainable goals. Machine learning is considered the latest solution for exploring the possibilities of improving WWTP operating status in future period by modelling. The primary indicators that affects the WWTP's efficiency are influent Chemical oxygen demand (COD), Nitrate concentration etc. Predicting the COD values can give us an idea about the energy consumption of the WWTP.  

> ***Objective***: To predict COD parameter of WWTP using random forest model and incorporating all in a GUI. 

> ***Python libraries***: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tkinter, glob

## Theory
### Random Forest model (RF) 
Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler are the creators of the widely used machine learning technique known as random forest, which mixes the output of various decision trees to produce a single outcome. Its widespread use is motivated by its adaptability and usability because it can solve classification and [regression problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis).

## List of files:
1. _config.py_ : Used to serve as an initial setting to call all necessary libraries and global variables.
2. _main.py_: Stand-alone script responsible for the main functions. 
3. _Data-Handling.py_: 
4. _Graph-Plots.py_: 
5.
